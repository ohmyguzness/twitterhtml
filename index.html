    <p> Thread of Lies is an installation piece that would allow Twitter users to delve deeper into the interworkings of Twitter through visually seeing the platform in a new light.
      Often the quick scrolls of a phone screen do not truly allow for people to question the validity of the content they consume.
    </P>
    <p> Twitter is constantly under a lot of scrutiny for refusing to regulate
      the spread of false information. For years, the platform has been swamped with racism, sexism, spam, and abuse.
       Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, states that "Twitter was [built] around communication and visualizing
      what was happening in the world in real-time", however the speed of information does not match the accuracy.
